NYC Real Estate Analysis - Perscriptive Analysis

This assignment (attached below) for the NYC Real Estate Market Analysis is where I combined time series forecasting with optimization techniques to evaluate real estate sales in my neighborhood (Upper East Side (59-79)). I forecasted future sales in R, then built an optimization model (in R) to maximize net present value (NPV) under given constraints. This assignment connected predictive modeling with managerial decision-making.
